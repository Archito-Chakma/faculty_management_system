# faculty_management_system
This is a web application for a faculty management system for a university website. Here we created three distinct web pages for Faculties, for Descriptions about faculties, and for departments. In the Faculties index files, we created three sections for the menu, for faculties, and for the footer. In the descriptions of faculty files, we put places for faculty information and departments. We created web pages for every single department. To build the project we used HTML, CSS, and PHP.
